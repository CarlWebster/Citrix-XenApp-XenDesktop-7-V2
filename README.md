# XenDesktop 7.x Version 2 Documentation Script
Creates an inventory of a Citrix XenDesktop (or XenApp) 7.8+ Site using Microsoft PowerShell and outputs to Microsoft Word, plain text or HTML.

To output to Microsoft Word, Office 2010 or above must be installed on the machine where the script is run from.

This Script requires at least PowerShell version 3 but runs best in version 5. You do NOT have to run this script on a Controller. This script was developed and run from a Windows 10 VM. You can run this script remotely using the â€“AdminAddress (AA) parameter.

		Machine Catalogs
		AppDisks

Using the MachineCatalogs parameter can cause the report to take a very long time to complete and can generate an extremely long report. Using the DeliveryGroups parameter can cause the report to take a very long time to complete and can generate an extremely long report.

Using both the MachineCatalogs and DeliveryGroups parameters can cause the report to take an extremely long time to complete and generate an exceptionally long report.
