#Version 2.12 10-Mar-2018
#	Fix $SQLVersion for SQL 2008 R2. Minor version is 50, not 5.
#	In application details, change from "Folder (for user)" to "Application category (optional)". 
#		This changed in XA/X 7.8 and I never noticed it and no one reported it.
#		Thanks to lbates for bringing it to my attention.
