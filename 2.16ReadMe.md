#Version 2.16 16-May-2018
#	Added a Note to the Help Text and ReadMe file about the Citrix.GroupPolicy.Commands module:
#		Note: The Citrix Group Policy PowerShell module will not load from an elevated PowerShell session. 
#		If the module is manually imported, the module is not detected from an elevated PowerShell session.
#	Changed a few arrays from "@() +=" to "New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList .Add()"
#	Changed the code where I checked for Singletons and -is [array] to use @() around the cmdlets so the result
#		is always an array. Thanks to fellow CTP Sam Jacobs for the tip. This reduced the code by almost 500 lines.
#	Remove Function GetComputerServices  as it is not used
#	Rollback changes made to the Policies region from Visual Studio Code as the changes broke policy output.
#		I spent days trying to debug what broke the output but realized it was just better to roll the code back 
#		to a working version.
#	Updated all Dropbox links to ShareFile links.
