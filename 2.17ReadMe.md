#Version 2.17
#	Added new Computer policy setting
#		ICA\Rendezvous Protocol (XA/XD 7.18)
#		To enhance the scalability of the Cloud Connector, use the Rendezvous protocol for the VDA to connect directly 
#		to the NetScaler Gateway Service. This new policy setting allows the VDA to establish an outbound connection 
#		to a Rendezvous point (Flow Redirector, a component on the NetScaler Gateway Service cloud), bypassing the 
#		Cloud Connector on a resource location for HDX traffic once the session is launched. Rendezvous Protocol is 
#		enabled by default and applies only to Citrix Cloud.
#	Added new User policy setting
#		ICA\Multimedia\Browser Content Redirection Authentication Sites (XA/XD 7.18)
#	Fixed a blank line in HTML output for Groom Retention Settings in Days (Found by Ken Avram)
#	Fixed HTML Hosting output for "Simultaneous actions..." where output showed System.Object[] (Found by Ken Avram)
#	In Function OutputAdministrators, fix for when $Admin.Rights.ScopeName and $Admin.Rights.RoleName are arrays (Found by Ken Avram)
#	In Function OutputDatastores, if the Principal, Mirror, Mirror Partner, or Mirror Witness contains a "\", 
#		then get the IP address for the server name before the "\" (Found by Ken Avram)
#		This should mean the database is running on SQL Server Express or has an Instance name
#	In Function OutputXenDesktopLicenses, fix for when the property LicenseExpirationDate is $Null which means 
#		the license Expiration Date is "Permanent" (Found by Ken Avram)
#	In Machine Catalog details, check if MetadataMap contains data, if so add it to output. For example:
#		ImageManagementPrep_DoImagePreparation True 
#		ImageManagementPrep_Excluded_Steps Not set 
#		ImageManagementPrep_NoAutoShutdown False

#	In Machine Catalog Details, for MCS catalogs, add Account Identity Pool data:
#		Account naming scheme
#		Naming scheme type
#		AD Domain
#		AD location (OU distinquished name)
#	Optimize Function ProcessCitrixPolicies by removing unneeded variable $WordTableRowHash. This removed almost 500
#		lines of code and almost 500 unneeded variable initializations
