#Version 2.13 7-Apr-2018
#	Added Operating System information to Functions GetComputerWMIInfo and OutputComputerItem
#	Code clean-up for most recommendations made by Visual Studio Code
#	During the code clean up, I came across some "unused" variables. I had just
#		forgotten to add them to the output. OOPS! They are now added.
#			Off Peak Buffer Size Percent
#			Off Peak Disconnect Timeout (Minutes)
#			Off Peak Extended Disconnect Timeout (Minutes)
#			Off Peak LogOff Timeout (Minutes)
#			Peak Buffer Size Percent
#			Peak Disconnect Timeout (Minutes)
#			Peak Extended Disconnect Timeout (Minutes)
#			Peak LogOff Timeout (Minutes)
#			Settlement Period Before Auto Shutdown (HH:MM:SS)
#			Settlement Period Before Use (HH:MM:SS)
#		Code clean up also found a copy and paste error with Session Linger
#			The "end session linger" value was still using the "end session prelaunch" variable
#			OOPS, sorry about that. Fixed.
