#Version 2.32 20-Mar-2020
#	Added to Delivery Group details, App Protection keyboard and screen capture settings
#		App protection is an add-on feature that provides enhanced security when using 
#		Citrix Workspace app. Two policies provide anti-keylogging and anti-screen-capturing 
#		capabilities in a session. The policies along with Citrix Workspace app 2001 or later 
#		for Mac can help protect data from keyloggers and screen scrapers.
#	Note:
#		If you connect from an older version of Citrix Workspace app, or from Citrix Receiver, 
#			these policies are not enabled.
#		Only workstation operating systems support app protection.
#	Thanks to fellow CTP Ryan Revord for testing this update
