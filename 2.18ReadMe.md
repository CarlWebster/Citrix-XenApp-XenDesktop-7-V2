#Version 2.18 5-Jun-2018
#	Added new Computer policy settings
#		ICA\Rendezvous Protocol (XA/XD 7.18)
#			To enhance the scalability of the Cloud Connector, use the Rendezvous protocol for the VDA to connect directly 
#			to the NetScaler Gateway Service. This new policy setting allows the VDA to establish an outbound connection 
#			to a Rendezvous point (Flow Redirector, a component on the NetScaler Gateway Service cloud), bypassing the 
#			Cloud Connector on a resource location for HDX traffic once the session is launched. Rendezvous Protocol is 
#			enabled by default and applies only to Citrix Cloud.
#		Profile Management\Advanced settings\Enable search index roaming for Outlook
#	Added new User policy setting
#		ICA\Multimedia\Browser Content Redirection Authentication Sites (XA/XD 7.18)
#	Tested with XenApp/XenDesktop 7.18
