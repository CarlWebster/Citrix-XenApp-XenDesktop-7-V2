# Created on October 20, 2013

#Version 2.37 5-Dec-2020
#	Added a ValidateSet to the Sections parameter. You can use -Section, press tab, and tab through all the section options. (Credit to Guy Leech)
#	Added new VDA registry key for 1912 CU2 VDAs
#		HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Citrix\Graphics\CursorShapeChangeMinInterval
#		HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Citrix\Audio\KeepAliveTimer
#		HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Citrix\Audio\KeepAliveTimer
#		HKLM:\Software\Policies\Citrix\VirtualDesktopAgent\SupportMultipleForestDdcLookup
#	Added to Hosting Connection section:
#	Thanks to fellow CTPs Neil Spellings, Kees Baggerman, and Trond Eirik Haavarstein for getting this info for me
#		Amazon EC2                                      
#		CloudPlatform                                   
#		Microsoft Azure
#		Microsoft Azure Classic
#		Microsoft Configuration Manager Wake on LAN    
#		Nutanix AHV
#	Added to the Site Settings section, Site Provisioning Settings based on CTX241288 (Thanks to Per Lorentzen)
#		https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX241288
#	Changed how the SQL Server Assembly is loaded because 1912 LTSR CU2 broke it
#	Fixed bug reported by David Prows in the Hosting section. First, check to see if the hosting connection's 
#		AdditionalStorage.StorageLocations is valid
#	Fixed some alignment issues in the text output
#	For all calls to Get-AdminAdministrator, remove the -SortBy Name. Sorting by Name is the default behavior.
#	For HTML and MSWord/PDF output, changed the formatting for the Application setting "How do you want to control the use of this application?"
#	For MCS Machine Catalogs:
#		Check that the catalog's ProvisioningSchemeId is not $Null before retrieving the Provision Scheme's machine data
#		Check that $MachneData is not $Null before checking for HostingUnitName
#	For the Hosting section, for High Availability Servers and Power Actions, handle empty arrays
#	In Function GetAdmins, for Hosting Connections, handle the error "The property 'ScopeId' cannot be found on this object. Verify that the property exists."
#		Also, add some white space to make the function easier for me to read
#	In Function OutputAdminsForDetails, add "No Admins found" to replace blank tables and text output
#	In Function OutputDeliveryGroupCatalogs, handle the case where a Delivery Group has no Machine Catalog(s) assigned
#	In Function OutputMachineDetails, when using Test-NetConnection, add Resolve-DnsName first to see if the machine name is resolvable. 
#		This prevents every call to Test-NetConnection from failing with "<MachineName> was not found in DNS". Add error message:
#		<MachineName> was not found in DNS. VDA Registry Key data cannot be gathered.
#		Otherwise, every machine was reported as offline, which may not be true.
#	In Function OutputPerZoneView, add "There are no zone members for Zone <ZoneName>" to replace blank tables and text output
#	In Function OutputXenDesktopLicenses, if there are no licenses installed, output the text "Citrix Virtual Desktops 7 Premium (30-day trial)"
#	Reformatted a lot of the HTML output
#	Reordered the parameters in an order recommended by Guy Leech
#	Updated the ReadMe file

#	Fix missing L_25 VDA Version checking for CVAD 2003
#	Fixed an issue with "Connections meeting any of the following (Access Gateway) filters".
#		If you selected HTML and any other output format in the same run, only the HTML output had any Access Gateway data.
#	Fixed an issue for RemotePC machine catalogs based on OUs. (Thanks to Rene Bigler)
#		Added all OUs defined
#		Added Allow SubOUs by each defined OU
#		Added machines excluded from the catalog
#		Added machines included in the catalog
#	Fixed issue with PowerShell 5.1.x and empty Hashtables for Ian Brighton's Word Table functions
#		PoSH 3, 4, and 5.0 had no problem with an empty hashtable and would create a blank Word table with only column headings
#		For many tables, before passing the hashtable to Ian's function, test if the hashtable is empty
#		If it is, create a dummy row of data for the hashtable
#		For example, a RemotePC catalog based on OU that contains no machines, or Applications with no administrators. 
#		Instead of having a missing table, the table will now have a row that says "None found"
#	Fixed output issues with Power Management settings
#	Fixed several more array out of bounds issues when accessing element 0 when the array was empty
#	For Appendix A, Text output, change the column heading "DDC Name" to "Computer Name" to match the HTML and MSWord/PDF output
#	For checking the registry on a Delivery Controller for installed Citrix components, test the RemoteRegistry service for its status.
#		If the service is not running, set $GotCtxComponents to $False
#	For the three datastore databases, check if the various variable are null or empty and if so, change the value to "Unable to determine"
#	For Zones, add MemType into the Sort-Object for Site View and Zone View
#	If BrokerRegistryKeys is True, test for elevation
#		Update help text to show elevation is required when using BrokerRegistryKeys
#	If PDF is selected for Output and Microsoft Word is not installed, update the error message to state that PDF uses Word's SaveAs PDF function
#	Remove the block on not processing Policies if running from an elevated session.
#		Citrix and I did a remote session to test this and we can't get it to fail.
#	Since the RegistrationState property is an enum, add .ToString() to the machine/desktop/server variable so HTML output is correct
#	When getting the Master VM for an MCS based machine catalog, also check for images ending in .template for Nutanix
#	When getting the provisioning scheme data for a machine, only process machines with a provisioning type of MCS
#		There is no provisioning scheme data for manually or PVS provisioned machines
#	When VDARegistryKeys is used, now test the RemoteRegistry service for its status.
#		If the service is not running, add that information into the AllVDARegistryItems array

#		Citrix Workspace app. Two policies provide anti-keylogging and anti-screen-capturing 
#		capabilities in a session. The policies along with Citrix Workspace app 2001 or later 
#		for Mac can help protect data from keyloggers and screen scrapers.
#	Note:
#		If you connect from an older version of Citrix Workspace app, or from Citrix Receiver, 
#			these policies are not enabled.
#		Only workstation operating systems support app protection.
#	Thanks to fellow CTP Ryan Revord for testing this update

#Version 2.18 5-Jun-2018
#	Added new Computer policy settings
#		ICA\Rendezvous Protocol (XA/XD 7.18)
#			To enhance the scalability of the Cloud Connector, use the Rendezvous protocol for the VDA to connect directly 
#			to the NetScaler Gateway Service. This new policy setting allows the VDA to establish an outbound connection 
#			to a Rendezvous point (Flow Redirector, a component on the NetScaler Gateway Service cloud), bypassing the 
#			Cloud Connector on a resource location for HDX traffic once the session is launched. Rendezvous Protocol is 
#			enabled by default and applies only to Citrix Cloud.

#	In Function OutputDatastores, if the Principal, Mirror, Mirror Partner, or Mirror Witness contains a "\", 
#		then get the IP address for the server name before the "\" (Found by Ken Avram)
#		This should mean the database is running on SQL Server Express or has an Instance name
#	In Function OutputXenDesktopLicenses, fix for when the property LicenseExpirationDate is $Null which means 
#		the license Expiration Date is "Permanent" (Found by Ken Avram)
#	In Machine Catalog details, check if MetadataMap contains data, if so add it to output. For example:
#		ImageManagementPrep_DoImagePreparation True 
#		ImageManagementPrep_Excluded_Steps Not set 
#		ImageManagementPrep_NoAutoShutdown False
#

#	Remove Function GetComputerServices  as it is not used
#	Rollback changes made to the Policies region from Visual Studio Code as the changes broke policy output.
#		I spent days trying to debug what broke the output but realized it was just better to roll the code back
