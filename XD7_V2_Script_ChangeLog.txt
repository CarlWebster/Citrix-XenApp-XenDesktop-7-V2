#		Appendix B is a list of all Controller registry keys sorted by key name, key value, and Controller name
#	Added processing the MetaDataMap properties for Machine Catalogs.
#		Sample possible Keys and Values:
#			Citrix_DesktopStudio_PreviousImageVdaFunctionalLevel_Is_L7_9 True 
#			Citrix_DesktopStudio_RdsCatalogLicenseCheck_Warning NoPoweredOnVm 
#				[Studio warning: The Microsoft Remote Desktop licensing check could not be run...]

#Version 2.18 5-Jun-2018
#	Added new Computer policy settings
#		ICA\Rendezvous Protocol (XA/XD 7.18)
#			To enhance the scalability of the Cloud Connector, use the Rendezvous protocol for the VDA to connect directly 
#			to the NetScaler Gateway Service. This new policy setting allows the VDA to establish an outbound connection 
#			to a Rendezvous point (Flow Redirector, a component on the NetScaler Gateway Service cloud), bypassing the 
#			Cloud Connector on a resource location for HDX traffic once the session is launched. Rendezvous Protocol is 
#			enabled by default and applies only to Citrix Cloud.

#	In Function OutputAdministrators, fix for when $Admin.Rights.ScopeName and $Admin.Rights.RoleName are arrays (Found by Ken Avram)
#	In Function OutputDatastores, if the Principal, Mirror, Mirror Partner, or Mirror Witness contains a "\", 
#		then get the IP address for the server name before the "\" (Found by Ken Avram)
#		This should mean the database is running on SQL Server Express or has an Instance name
#	In Function OutputXenDesktopLicenses, fix for when the property LicenseExpirationDate is $Null which means 
#		the license Expiration Date is "Permanent" (Found by Ken Avram)
#	In Machine Catalog details, check if MetadataMap contains data, if so add it to output. For example:
#		ImageManagementPrep_DoImagePreparation True 
#		ImageManagementPrep_Excluded_Steps Not set 
#		ImageManagementPrep_NoAutoShutdown False
#

#	Changed a few arrays from "@() +=" to "New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList .Add()"
#	Changed the code where I checked for Singletons and -is [array] to use @() around the cmdlets so the result
#		is always an array. Thanks to fellow CTP Sam Jacobs for the tip. This reduced the code by almost 500 lines.
#	Remove Function GetComputerServices  as it is not used
#	Rollback changes made to the Policies region from Visual Studio Code as the changes broke policy output.
#		I spent days trying to debug what broke the output but realized it was just better to roll the code back 
#		to a working version.
#	Updated all Dropbox links to ShareFile links.

#			Off Peak Disconnect Timeout (Minutes)
#			Off Peak Extended Disconnect Timeout (Minutes)
